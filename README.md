## Tutor-Finder
We will create a web application that connects students with available tutors. We will design and implement a frontend and backend for basic profile management, meeting scheduling, a messaging system that allows students and tutors to communicate directly with each other, a built-in calendar and cancelling or rescheduling meetings. The website will be designed to meet accessibility standards, following WCAG guidelines, and will be mobile compatible. Visual design will adhere to CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) design principles, ensuring that the interface is aesthetically pleasing and functional. There will be no external funding and a strict timeline of three months to meet the project deadline.

## Setup Instructions
1. Run **npm install** to install all packages. See the package.json file for specifics on what packages are currently installed in the app.
2. Run **npm run setup** to clone .env.example to a new .env file
3. Fill out the .env with all the proper environment variables. These variables can be found within the comments section of our Sprint 3 submission.
4. Run **node app.js** to start the server
5. The server is now running and you can use the web app.
